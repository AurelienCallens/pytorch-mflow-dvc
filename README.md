Including MLOps in pytorch project: Classification of sea animals images with pytorch
==============================

## Overview of the project

This deep learning project aims to classify images of 19 different sea animals. The dataset comes from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/sea-animals-image-dataste/code

This test project had several objectives:
   - Learn how to use pytorch (pytorch-lightning) for computer vision 
   - Include MLOps tools into my workflow such as:
      + DVC for data version control and pipeline
      + MLflow for experiment tracking 


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The dependencies can be installed with the `requirements.txt` file: 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
### Training the model
